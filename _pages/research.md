## Research Interest

My research interest is in animal breeding, quantitative genetics and
computational biology. It is evident that the advancement in animal breeding and genetics has been
fundamental to the large productivity gains that have been achieved by the livestock production
sector around the world. More recently, genomics, A.I. for large-scale phenotyping technologies,
advanced statistical methods were added to the animal breeding toolkit, enabling even faster
improvements in production efficiency. My graduate and postdoctoral training is focused on
genetic improvement of economically relevant traits in dairy and beef cattle, including production,
health, fertility, heat-stress, genotype-by-environment interactions. I integrate on-farm
performance records with genomics and enviromics data and ML/AI methods to develop selection
tools, and data-driven strategies for optimizing breeding and farm management decisions. I have
over 10 years of experience in teaching and research in animal breeding and genetics.
